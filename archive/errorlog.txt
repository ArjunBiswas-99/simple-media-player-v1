another big issue

Visual Observation When examining the red highlight around the Play button, I see the following:
The highlight is a thick red outline.

It clearly runs along the bottom curve of the circular button shape.

It extends up along the left and right sides (middle parts) of the circle.

Crucially, the highlight stops abruptly or is missing entirely across the top curve of the circular button shape.

The Problem This Creates This incomplete, crescent-shaped highlight is a severe usability issue because it violates fundamental UI design principles:
Signals a Glitch, Not a State: In standard software interfaces, a partial border almost always indicates a rendering error or a graphical glitch. A user's first thought is likely to be that the program is broken, not that this is a deliberate design feature.

Breaks Visual Consistency: The eye expects a complete and uniform visual ring or shape for a hover state on a circular button. By omitting the top part, the design feels unbalanced, unstable, and unfinished.

Weakens Affordance: The design's primary job is to tell the user, "This is a button you can click." An incomplete highlight weakens that signal, making the interaction feel less precise and less reliable

Dont do anything just see and undersntand and tell me what u uderstood
